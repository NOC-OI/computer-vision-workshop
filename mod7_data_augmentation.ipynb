    "# Module 7 - Data augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, the number of images per class in the labeled datasets we work with are limited by a variety of factors. This is sometimes due to natural variablitiy in the population being observed. Other times, due to contraints in terms of human annotation costs. The result is that the distribution of classes in the trainin set is uneven.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, having an uneven training set is not an issue if it the disparity between the classes reflects the natural population. But in the ocean, populations can fluctuate so rapidly in time and space, it is sometimes preferable to have a classifier trained on a uniform class distribtution. This in effect biases the classifier to think each type of organism is equally likely to be imaged. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, there would be enough training images that one could simply subsample each class until the distribution is uniform. But as with the SPC training data provided for the workshop, this is often not the case. One solution is to use *data augmentation* to artifically increase the size of certain classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of data augmentation involves poking and proding images to look subtly different using the image transformations described in module 2. Then as the network is being trained, it is shown different versions of the same organism. Caution needs to be exercised when using this procedure. It is very easy to overfit the classifier to your data."
