    "\n",
    "Before the popularization of deep learning, many applied automatic classification algorithms were variations on ensemble or margin classifiers. Both types of classifiers operate on pre-defined features. As we will see later, this is fundamentally different from neural networks which can learn directly from the images. For now, we will make use of the features pulled from SPC data in the last module."
