# NOC Computer Vision Workshop 2025

Authors: Eric Orenstein (National Oceanography Centre) and Simon-Martin Schroder (University of Kiel)

This set of Jupyter notebooks was designed to introduce biological oceanographers to some tools available for image processing and machine learning. The original material was developed for the [Partnership for Observing the Global Ocean's](https://oceandecade.org/actions/partnership-for-observation-of-the-global-ocean-pogo/) [2019 Workshop on Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence in Biological Observations](https://pogo-ocean.org/capacity-development/activity-related-workshop/pogo-workshop-on-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence-in-biological-oceanographic-observations/) by [Eric Orenstein](https://eor314.github.io/) and [Simon-Martin Schroder](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6603-9907) (University of Kiel).  

The notebooks guide users through manipulating plankton images from the [Scripps Plankton Camera System](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lom3.10394) and the [ZooScan](https://sites.google.com/view/piqv/) with a variety of computer vision techniuqes, from basic image manipulation to semantic classification with convolutional neural networks. Later modules use the [LILA BC Ohio Small Animals](https://lila.science/datasets/ohio-small-animals/) dataset to introduce the commonly used COCO data format and advanced computer vision techniques.
